## Introduction
### Overview
This project is born out of a passion for combining the power of coding with the beauty of physics. Inspired by the enlightening approach of 3blue1brown and the capabilities of p5.js, this endeavor seeks to bridge the gap between static 3D images and a deep understanding of complex structures.

### Motivation
In physics, the power of visualization cannot be overstated. Traditional static images often fall short in conveying the intricacies of crystal structures, vector fields, 3D functions and other concepts. Recognizing this limitation during a solid state physics lecture, I embarked on a coding journey initially for the sheer joy of learning and exploring.

### Evolution from Processing to p5.js
Having previously created a simple cubic model using Processing, the project gradually evolved as I discovered the versatility of p5.js, a JavaScript library designed for drawing and animations. What made it even more appealing was its compatibility with any web browser, eliminating the need for specific software installations.
